# Building an LLM from Scratch - Complete Tutorial

A hands-on, step-by-step guide to building a Large Language Model trained on Biblical texts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:
- How text is converted to numbers (tokenization)
- How neural networks represent words (embeddings)
- How transformers understand context (attention mechanisms)
- How to train a language model from scratch
- How to generate text with your trained model

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes, loops)
- Basic understanding of arrays/matrices
- No deep learning experience required! We'll learn as we go.

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Run the code** - Don't just read it, execute it!
2. **Experiment** - Change parameters and see what happens
3. **Take notes** - Write down your observations
4. **Ask questions** - If something is unclear, investigate why
5. **Be patient** - Building an LLM is complex, but we'll tackle it piece by piece
